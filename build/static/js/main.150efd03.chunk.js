For the\n      Carlton, this included relevant staff from MHL Development, PM, and RS, as well outside partners as\n      needed. This call and follow-up emails provided us the floorplans and blueprints for the Carlton\n      renovation from the partnered architecture firm, then the moving dates as coordinated by the\n      partnered relocation specialists, and countless other important pieces of information throughout\n      the resyndication process. I would encourage you to make note of decisions made on these calls\n      independently.

These meetings should offer space for residents to\n      provide feedback and ask questions. Make every attempt to achieve 100% resident attendance at\n      these meetings. Once the paint has dried and tenants move back, construction is complete. These community meetings will be residents\u2019 only opportunity to provide their opinions on the\n      renovations to occur in their homes. These meetings may occur in-person, but may also include an option for residents to call in and participate over the phone. If residents choose to call in, you may need to be available to assist with connecting them to the correct meeting."},{title:"(2.2) Analyze blueprints and workplans",content:"Generally, there will not be a ton of room for negotiation as to the design plans for specific\n      units. At the Carlton, no walls came down above the first floor, meaning that most units could not\n      become any bigger (or smaller) and certain wish-list items that residents wanted (bigger\n      closets, for example) were not possible. However, various changes were made to\n      Carlton units on each floor to accommodate residents with disabilities, suchs as hearing-impaired\n      doorbells or lower countertops.\n      Keep in mind that you will have the ability to influence the\n      direction of the renovation for the RS space. Keep an eye on plans specifically for furniture options, electrical and\n      data jack placements. One thing we never considered at the Carlton was our RS space renovation included automatic lighting, with no light switch on the wall to control it. Upon returning, I wished we\n      had the ability to turn off the lights for a weekly meditation group, but we could not receive this\n      accommodation after the work was complete."},{title:"(2.3) Create a relocation guide with PM input",content:"Finally, as construction plans are finalized and approved, and residents receive their\n      relocation units and tentative moving dates, begin creating a Relocation Guide to provide to\n      tenants. It will be helpful for all relocated MHL tenants to receive a document explaining that they\n      are still obligated to the terms of their lease with Mercy Housing. This means they will be expected\n      to pay their tenant portion of rent, submitting checks or money orders, just like they would under\n      normal circumstances. Solicit input from your PM team for this document; you will need to provide\n      tenants with the mailing address for your PM team. If the building undergoes a total\n      rehab, mail service will be suspended for the property and rent payment will need to go to PM\u2019s\n      temporary office, perhaps at a different MHL property.\n      If your resyndication property has the good luck of relocating most of your tenants to a single\n      location (or neighborhood), then you should also consider researching the food pantries and other\n      social service resources in that community. Since most Carlton tenants were relocated to a single\n      building in Edgewater, in our relocation guide I included information about the nearest food pantry\n      and the CTA bus routes near the building. The partnered relocation specialists can be helpful\n      here too, as (for the Carlton at least) they provided every tenant a USPS change-of-address request\n      form upon their relocation."}];function b(){return Object(s.jsxs)("div",{className:"page-content",children:[Object(s.jsx)("h1",{children:"\u2192 Before"}),Object(s.jsx)("div",{className:"accordion",children:y.map((function(e){var t=e.title,n=e.content;return Object(s.jsx)(p,{title:t,content:n})}))})]})}var w=[{title:"(3.1) Wellbeing checks for high-risk residents",content:"With your tenants out of the property, you are now fully in the relocation phase of the\n      resyndication process. Depending on details specific to your property, you may find this new and\n      temporary workflow to be either more or less stressful than the regular day-to-day Case Manager\n      experience. In general, I tried to maintain the same workflow as usual. At the beginning of each\n      month, I prioritized the annual and six-month updates for my funded residents, reaching out to\n      them and arranging to meet them at a neutral location to complete this paperwork. For the Carlton,\n      we had the good luck of being offered common area space at the primary relocation property for RS\n      staff to set-up shop. I created a Google Voice number to communicate with residents from my\n      cell phone (without using my actual cell phone number) and arranged for them to meet me in the common area as needed.\n      Some of your property's residents likely have a greater level of\n      self-sufficiency and do not engage much with Resident Services. Just like under\n      normal circumstances, these residents should handle relocation without incident, although you may\n      need to stress the temporary nature of their move (see 3.3). However, certain high-risk tenants,\n      whether relocated inside or outside of MHL, will benefit from even more attention and outreach\n      than provided at your property. Consider visiting your high-risk tenants early and often throughout\n      relocation, particularly if they are consistently unavailable by telephone. One resident from the Carlton\n      had been, due to cognitive decline from aging and drinking, consistently unable to use a telephone. I\n      made sure to assist him with rent payment each month and provided more than one \u201cwalking tour\u201d\n      of his new neighborhood, ensuring he could get to the nearest grocery store and currency exchange.\n      Of course, the specific needs of your tenants may be different and may require different approaches."},{title:"(3.2) Form a relationship with outside (relocation) housing provider management when possible",content:"For the duration of the construction project, your tenants will have two property managers. They will still be tenants with MHL and pay rent to the PM team for your property,\n      and (at least on paper) be expected to follow the House Rules laid out in their MHL lease. However,\n      they will be physically living at a different location with a different management team for some period of time, and that\n      team will do their best to ensure safe and equitable living conditions for all their tenants,\n      including their MHL transplants. As much as possible, attempt to form a working relationship with\n      the staff at the relocation property.\n      I imagine this relationship will look different based on the details of the specific property or\n      properties where tenants are placed for relocation. For example, all your MHL tenants might be\n      in a large building that has a spare office space which the building management will allow you to use\n      during business hours, and you can create a makeshift temporary office not so different from the\n      regular RS spaces in MHL properties. On the other hand, all your tenants might be scattered into\n      various two- or three-flat properties with no common areas to meet in. The reality will probably be\n      in the middle of these two extremes. For the Carlton\u2019s relocation, most tenants were at a large\n      apartment complex (about 300 units) in which the property manager graciously allowed RS staff to work from a\n      \n      table in the hallway across from the mailboxes. I would make myself available to tenants in this\n      space three times a week, while working from a temporary office at MHL's Miriam Apartments the rest of the time."},{title:"(3.3) Stress the temporary nature of relocation to tenants wanting to stay at relocation units",content:"In their communications with tenants, starting from the initial meetings months prior to\n      resyndication (see 2.1), the relocation specialists will inform residents that they will be temporarily\n      moved into market-rate housing for the duration of construction, and that they are free to apply for\n      a lease and thereby to stay at the temporary housing, without Mercy Housing\u2019s assistance. As you\n      might imagine, certain residents will use their selective hearing to understand this to mean that they\n      are free to stay at their temporary apartment indefinitely, under the same terms and conditions of\n      their MHL lease. Firmly push back against this misunderstanding.\n      Residents that can afford to enter a standard, unsubsidized lease agreement with the temporary\n      housing provider are certainly free to do so, and some Carlton tenants did exactly that. However,\n      many MHL residents have not rented without the support of a subsidy in years, if ever. Explain to\n      these residents that they would need to apply, the same way any other renter would, for tenancy,\n      and then need to meet the landlord\u2019s expectations for credit, criminal background, and minimum\n      income. A person living on a fixed income from Social Security at $914 per month, for example,\n      would not be approved for an apartment that charges $900 per month for rent. Moreover, applying for that\n      apartment might cost them a non-refundable application fee. You will do well to have a prepared\n      simple explanation as to the nature of the resident\u2019s lease with MHL, because another set of\n      residents will be under the impression that their \u201cvoucher\u201d is transferable, like a Section 8 voucher\n      would be. We are not housing counselors and as RS staff we are not even housing providers, so\n      while you can certainly assist residents in getting on various waitlists, or attempting to secure\n      transferable rental assistance, you are not able to offer rent subsidies for our residents to move into\n      new housing. It is best to be clear and straightforward in the requirement of returning to your MHL property\n      if a resident would like to keep their rental subsidy."},{title:"(3.4) Request funds for travel reimbursement and stamped envelopes to provide tenants",content:"The amount of money a case manager needs will change during relocation. On the one hand,\n      you will not be able to host regular groups and building events such as monthly birthday parties or\n      coffee hours. On the other hand, you will have increased transportation costs (whether driving or\n      using public transit) incurred from visiting tenants. You will also benefit from having a supply of\n      stamps and envelopes to assist residents with rent payment. If your residents are walking distance\n      from your building\u2019s temporary PM location, all the better, but in most cases at least some tenants\n      will prefer to mail their rent. Discuss with your manager how to secure this funding, and make sure\n      you have access to the latest MHL mileage reimbursement forms."},{title:"(3.5) Participate and solicit tenant participation with community art partners",content:"Finally, all the recent MHL syndications have included a partnership with a community arts\n      organization that will assist in the creation and installation of artwork to celebration the building\u2019s\n      renovation. For the Carlton at least, this part of the process was rather smooth and during our weekly resyndication call, the RED team introduced a representative from Architreasures,\n      the community art organization responsible for soliciting custom original artwork installations for\n      the renovated property. This representative gave us an array of artist applications to consider and\n      \n      asked for our help in picking one artist for the job. Once landing on an artist, they reached out to us\n      for help involving tenants in creating some of the murals. The role of RS here, much like with the\n      community meetings prior to resyndication, amounts to maximizing tenant engagement.

Due to the pressures from funders and various tax incentives, it\n      is at least possible that the renovated property will re-open and begin returning its tenants before\n      the building is 100% complete and ready-for-use in all spaces. As the on-site staff, it is the responsibility of RS\n      staff and PM staff to continually advocate for the building\u2019s needs. Following staff\u2019s return to the\n      Carlton, the first tenants to move back began arriving almost immediately and spent about 4 weeks\n      without laundry machines or active internet/cable jacks. Other small inconvenient things were also\n      still on back-order, or otherwise unfinished. For example, our PM purchased 100+ plastic storage\n      bins to offer residents while they waited for their dressers to be delivered. If your resyndication has\n      similar issues, all you can do is continually advocate for your tenants, who might blame you for\n      things that are outside your control. Understand that this is natural, since after all you (along with\n      other site staff from PM team) are the MHL employees that they see every day. Don\u2019t take it\n      personally."},{title:"(4.2) Expect an expedited lease-up and prioritize responsibilities with supervisor",content:"Finally, depending on the specific circumstances of your building\u2019s resyndication, you\n      may be expected to deal with a rapid lease-up process, in addition to supporting tenants in\n      their moves back and handling some of the potential challenges described above. During\n      relocation the property may lose tenants through normal attrition (death, residents finding\n      other housing opportunities, moving out-of-state), so upon return the occupancy rate\n      will be lower. At the Carlton, this occupancy metric was tied to the renovation funding in such\n      a way that the building needed to be 100% occupied within about six weeks of its reopening.\n      This meant completing intakes for 3-5 new tenants each week during this period. Work\n      closely with your supervisor to prioritize accordingly and ask for help as needed. I found it\n      useful to have intake packets printed and organized before meeting with tenants and I\n      developed a good routine of completing all the required paperwork while still acting warm\n      and welcoming; such a practice is outside the scope of this guide, but in general I suggest\n      making the intake friendly and conversational, while still addressing all the required questions\n      for the paperwork."},{title:"(4.3) Be (extra) flexible",content:"Lastly, and this is only a reiteration of 1.3, but throughout resyndication, and especially\n      upon returning to the building, allow yourself to be flexible. In my opinion, you simply\n      \n      cannot be rigid in your expectations for what each day will look like while returning to the\n      renovated MHL property. You may have three unexpected move-ins on a Friday, for\n      example. You might think that such a thing could only happen due to a breakdown in\n      communication between PM and RS, but during the Carlton lease-up this was not the case.\n      Given the expedited lease-up process, we had various tenant applications and had to be\n      prepared to move them in when they arrived. Two of the Friday move-in tenants may have been\n      \u201cscheduled\u201d to sign leases and move in on Wednesday and Thursday, but if they did not\n      appear at their appointments and then showed up on Friday, we of course moved them in\n      on Friday. You might also be surprised that, for example, a resident that has not previously\n      struggled with hoarding impulses, may have filled up their larger temporary unit with all\n      kinds of new belongings that they will then attempt to stuff back into their SRO Mercy\n      Housing unit. You may have a resident that is calling you in tears refusing to move back to\n      your property at all, and they might be calling you while the relocation specialists and the\n      movers are knocking at their door on their scheduled move-back date. You may need to\n      directly contact construction managers at internet provider companies to figure out why\n      none of the tenant phone/data/internet jacks appear to be hooked up.
